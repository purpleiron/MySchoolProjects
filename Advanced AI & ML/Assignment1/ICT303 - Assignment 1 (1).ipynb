Description**\n","\n","We would like to develop, using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a computer program that takes images of handwritten text, finds the written characters in the image and displays the written characters.\n","\n","To achieve this, we will proceed in steps:\n","\n","1. Develop and train an MLP for the recognition of handwritten characters from images. In the first instance, the images are assumed to contain only one handwritten.\n","2. Train and test the MLP, and evaluate its performance by using loss curves and proper accuracy/performance measures\n","3. Improve the performance of the MLP by tuning its hyper parameters.\n","4. Extend the program you developed to localize (detect) and recognize handwritten characters in an image that contains multiple handwritten characters.\n","\n","For this purpose, we will use the following dataset for training, validation and testing: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset.\n","\n","You are required to justify every design choice. Justifications should be theoretical and validated with experiments.\n","\n","It is important that you start as earlier as possible. Coding is usually easy. However, training neural networks and tuning its hyper-parameters takes time."],"metadata":{"id":"by2yigAYoub0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**2.

This includes:\n","  - A class that defines the network architecture that extends the class `nn.Module`. It should have a constructor method (`__init__()`) and a forward function (`forward()`)\n","  - The Trainer class\n","  - A main function\n","\n","- Training working and running on GPU **[10 marks]**\n","\n","- Curves for training loss and validation loss plotted and training stopped when the network starts to overfit (i.e., when the validation loss starts to increase). You must use TensorBoard to visualize curves and monitor performance **[10 marks]**\n","\n","- Testing code properly working. **[10 marks]**\n","\n","- Hyper parameters finetuned and the best ones selected. **[10 marks]**\n","\n","- Quality of the dicussions **[20 marks]**: did the student discuss various design choices, including the hyperparamters or any choices they made to improve the performance?
