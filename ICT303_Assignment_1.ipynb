        "To achieve this, we will proceed in steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Develop and train an MLP for the recognition of handwritten characters from images. In the first instance, the images are assumed to contain only one handwritten.\n",
        "2. Train and test the MLP, and evaluate its performance by using loss curves and proper accuracy/performance measures\n",
        "3. Improve the performance of the MLP by tuning its hyper parameters.\n",
        "4. Extend the program you developed to localize (detect) and recognize handwritten characters in an image that contains multiple handwritten characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this purpose, we will use the following dataset for training, validation and testing: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset.\n",
